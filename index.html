                                <b>Coding</b>. I love to learn. And there is a LOT to learn, especially right now.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b>Educating consumers</b>. I have hands-on domain expertise in health insurance and personal finance. The world has never been more complicated and I love to help people in a few complicated areas of life.

                                <b>Gaming</b>. I won a gaming card national championship when I was 15 years old. As an adult I was 2nd in a DraftKings competition of 250,000 players. Today there are more ways to earn income and prestige from gaming than ever before, and I find some of them very interesting.

<!-- Things To Fix -->

<!-- Header looks absolutely hideous, this is my #1 item to work on. If you can look at what I've done and say, "Chris, you clearly don't understand X Y and Z in CSS - here's what you need to review/learn/work on"-- that will be really helpful to me. -->

<!-- Need hamburger menu for top navigation but might have to save that as a to-do for JavaScript class -->

<!-- Need to style the <hr> tags -->
